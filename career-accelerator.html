<!-- GUARANTEE -->
    <section class="section section-highlight">
      <h2>Money-Back Guarantee</h2>
      <p>
        I stand behind the Better Career Cohort. If you complete the program and
        don’t feel more confident, clearer, and better prepared to land your next
        opportunity, I’ll refund your tuition.
      </p>
      <h3>How the guarantee works</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>You attend all live sessions (or watch the recordings if you have a conflict).</li>
        <li>You complete the weekly templates/assignments in good faith.</li>
        <li>
          If you still don’t feel the cohort was worth the investment, email me within
          7 days of the final session.
        </li>
        <li>You’ll receive a 100% refund—no hassle.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- GIFTING -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>Give the Cohort as a Gift</h2>
      <p>
        You can also purchase enrollment as a gift for someone who needs career support:
        a friend in transition, a family member graduating, or a colleague you want to support.
      </p>
      <h3>How gifting works</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Go to the application Google Form and select
          <strong>“It's a gift for someone else.”</strong>
        </li>
        <li>Provide the recipient’s name and email address.</li>
        <li>
          You can optionally add a short gift message that we’ll include in their welcome email.
        </li>
        <li>
          If they’re a good fit for the cohort, we’ll send them next steps and a payment link
          (or coordinate with you, depending on what you select in the form).
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        This is a great way to give someone not just advice, but a structured path and
        community to move their career forward.

    <!-- HOW IT WORKS -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>How Enrollment Works</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Apply via Google Form.</strong><br />
          Share a bit about your background, current situation, and goals. Indicate if the
          enrollment is for you or a gift.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Fit check.</strong><br />
          I review each application to make sure the cohort is a good match and that
          the mix of participants will support one another.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Payment & confirmation.</strong><br />
          If accepted, you’ll receive a payment link and details about dates, times,
          and pre-work.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Cohort kickoff.</strong><br />
          We meet weekly, build momentum, and leave you with repeatable templates
          and a stronger career story.

    <!-- FAQ (optional, tweak as needed) -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>Common Questions</h2>

      <h3>Who is this cohort for?</h3>
      <p>
        Mid-career professionals, emerging leaders, and people in transition who want
        a more intentional, strategic approach to their next role—not just firing off
        more applications.
      </p>

      <h3>Can I join if I’m already employed?</h3>
      <p>
        Yes. Many participants are currently employed but exploring what’s next, getting
        ready for internal moves, or wanting to be more intentional about their career.
      </p>

      <h3>What if I can’t attend one of the live sessions?</h3>
      <p>
        Sessions are recorded, and you can watch the replay. To qualify for the
        money-back guarantee, you’ll need to attend or watch all sessions and complete
        the assignments.
      </p>

      <h3>How do refunds work?</h3>
      <p>
        If you meet the guarantee conditions and request a refund within 7 days of the
        final session, I’ll refund 100% of your tuition to your original payment method.
