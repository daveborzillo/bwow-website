      <section class="about-content">
        <p>
          Welcome! I'm Dave Borzillo, founder of Better Ways of Working (BWOW).
          I help leaders, teams, and organizations discover practical, modern
          approaches to collaboration, communication, and getting meaningful
          work done.
        </p>

        <p>
          For more than a decade, I’ve coached executives, guided complex
          transformations, taught at the BU Agile Innovation Lab, and led teams
          recognized as internal disruptors. I’ve done this work inside Fortune 500
          companies, helping leaders and teams adopt better ways of working in some
          of the most complex environments in industry. My work blends Agile, Lean,
          facilitation, leadership development, and systems thinking into clear,
          actionable methods that help people move from frustration to momentum.
        </p>

        <h2>What I Do</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Coach leaders and teams to collaborate more effectively</li>
          <li>Teach frameworks like Liberating Structures, Visual Collaboration, and Scrum</li>
          <li>Run cohort-based programs like the Better Career Cohort</li>
          <li>Facilitate alignment, strategic clarity, and forward progress</li>
          <li>
            Write and speak about modern ways of working, including my book
            <em>Who Killed Agile?</em>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>My Mission</h2>
        <p>
          My mission is to help people who genuinely care about doing great work
          unlock their potential by removing the unnecessary friction that holds
          organizations back. I believe work should feel clearer, more connected,
          and more human.
        </p>

        <h2>My Approach</h2>
        <p>I focus on:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Practicality over theory</strong> — everything I teach works in real environments</li>
          <li><strong>Simplicity</strong> — clarity creates confidence</li>
          <li><strong>Psychological safety and openness</strong> — where real collaboration can happen</li>
          <li><strong>Flow</strong> — reducing delays, confusion, and stalled decisions</li>
          <li><strong>Empowering others</strong> — so progress continues long after I'm gone</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Navigating the Future with AI</h2>
        <p>
          Artificial intelligence isn’t just a trend—it's a new layer of how
          work gets done. And for me, AI isn’t new. In the late 90s, I worked on
          knowledge-based systems (an early form of AI that represented the state
          of the art at the time) and helped implement those systems across several
          aerospace companies. Even then, the goal was the same as it is now:
          capture expertise, improve decision-making, and make complex work easier.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today’s AI is exponentially more capable, and I believe leaders and
          teams need to learn how to work <em>with</em> it, not fear it or ignore
          it. Used well, AI can reduce friction, improve clarity, accelerate
          decisions, and free people to focus on meaningful, human-centered work.
          A big part of my mission now is helping people integrate AI into their
          day-to-day flow in practical, trustworthy ways.
        </p>

        <h2>Why I Started Better Ways of Working</h2>
        <p>
          After years inside organizations where people were overwhelmed by
          frameworks, meetings, and misalignment, I built BWOW to give leaders
          and teams something better: practical tools, powerful facilitation
          methods, and a community that feels energizing instead of exhausting.
        </p>

        <h2>A Bit of My Story</h2>
        <p>
          My career began in environments where smart people struggled not because
          they lacked skill, but because their ways of working held them back. I
          became obsessed with solving that—first with tools and systems, and now
          by improving how people work together. Now, through coaching, training,
          writing, and programs, I help others remove that friction and unlock the
          impact they’re capable of.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you're someone who cares about doing great work and wants to discover
          better ways to lead, collaborate, and innovate—you’re in the right place.
        </p>

        <h2>BWOW Is Bigger Than Me</h2>
        <p>
          Better Ways of Working isn’t just my perspective—it’s a growing
          network of like-minded coaches, facilitators, and practitioners who
          bring their own expertise and lived experience. I actively partner
          with other leaders who specialize in areas like organizational design,
          leadership development, disruption strategy, and team dynamics.
          Together, we create richer programs, stronger support systems, and more
          impactful learning experiences for the people we serve.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you’re someone who cares about doing meaningful work, wants to
          improve how you and your teams collaborate, and believes there
          <em>has</em> to be a better way—you’re in the right place.
